		<h4>Your Account</h4>
		<p class="first">2DCU4Three could not be easier to use. Upon downloading the app, simply make an account for free using your
		valid student ID number and phone number that will be verified by us. You will then be brought to your homepage which can be
		customised with a profile picture and a status. Youâ€™re all set. If you forget your password, we have you covered. An email will 
		be sent to you so you can create a new, hopefully easier password to remember. If there are
		any other queries do not hesitate to contact us. Now start saving money!</p>
