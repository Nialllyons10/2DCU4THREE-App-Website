		<h4>How it works</h4>
		<p class="first">
		DCU4Three is a free application for Android and iPhone that allows DCU students to share a taxi with 
		other students when they are faced with a journey home 
		on their own that would cost close to 20euro. You simply input your current location, the time you wish to leave and then your destination into
		the app and the app will then find other students that
		are going the same way as you cutting the cost for everyone!
		There is a built-in map that will show your location and the location of other students sharing with you which will determine your route home. The taxi company is then 
		notified and will pick you up and bring you home.
		Another feature is a built in chat interface which allows you to communicate with other people who are sharing the taxi with you to make sure no-one gets left 
		behind if they are running a bit late. 
		There is added security due to the fact only DCU students with valid DCU e-mails can use the app, everyone you take a trip home with will be in the same college as you!

		<h4>Why this app?</h4>
		<p class="first">
		We choose to develop this App because we are all DCU students who have been caught on our own at some time and 
		were faced with an expensive taxi drive home. Since so many students live near one another and other people are often left on their own 
		we thought it would be a good idea to have an app that let you share your fare home with other people, cutting costs massively. 
		Sometimes it is un-avoidable, of course, but we are trying to make sure that you spend as much money as possible enjoying yourself and not travelling around the city.
